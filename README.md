# Mango Detection Project

## Overview

This project aims to implement a machine learning model for **mango classification**. The dataset includes various images and Jupyter notebooks for training and testing models like **ResNet** and **Vision Transformer (VIT)**. Each file corresponds to a model or experiment related to mango classification.

## Files

The project contains the following files:

* **mango10.ipynb, mango20.ipynb, mango30.ipynb, etc.**: These Jupyter notebooks contain different experiments and models related to mango classification at various stages. They include data pre-processing, model training, and evaluation steps.
* **mangoresnet.ipynb**: This notebook applies the **ResNet** architecture for mango classification.
* **mangovit.ipynb, mangovit10.ipynb, mangovit20.ipynb, etc.**: These notebooks use **Vision Transformer (VIT)** models to classify mangoes.

## Classification

This project focuses on **image classification** where the goal is to classify images of mangoes into various categories. Each notebook explores different techniques and model architectures to optimize the classification accuracy. The classification workflow typically follows these steps:

1. **Data Pre-processing**:

   * Loading and preparing the dataset (e.g., resizing images, data augmentation).
   * Label encoding and splitting into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Model Training**:

   * Training models using different architectures such as **ResNet** and **Vision Transformer (VIT)**.
   * Hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy.

3. **Model Evaluation**:

   * Testing the model on unseen data (test set).
   * Metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **confusion matrix** are used to evaluate the model’s performance.

4. **Results**:

   * Comparing the classification results across different models and architectures.
   * Analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of each model based on the evaluation metrics.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karibshams/mango-detection.git
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open any of the Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) to explore the models.
2. Run the notebook cells to see how the model trains on the mango dataset.
3. Modify the code to experiment with different architectures, such as changing parameters or using new data.
